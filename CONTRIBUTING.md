# Contributing to SwiftTOON

1. Review `docs/plans/plan.md` and `docs/reference/agents.md` for project expectations.
2. Run `swift test --enable-code-coverage` and any relevant benchmarks before sending a PR.
3. Use TDD: add failing tests first, then implement, then update docs/README/badges as needed.
4. Keep documentation (README, plan, agent handbook) up-to-date with every behavioral change.
5. Describe performance impact in your PR summary and attach benchmark diffs when touching hot paths.
